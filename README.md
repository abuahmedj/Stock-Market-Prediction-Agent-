Agentic AI Stock Market Predictor is a first-semester project that demonstrates the fundamentals of agentic AI systems applied to real-world financial data.
The application uses multiple AI agents that work together to fetch real-time stock data, analyze market news sentiment, and generate trading decisions (BUY, HOLD, or SELL).

Built using Python, Streamlit, yFinance, Plotly, and LLMs via OpenRouter, the system follows an agent-based architecture where each agent has a clearly defined role:

A Data Agent collects live market prices and news

A Sentiment Agent evaluates market sentiment using AI models

A Decision Agent produces trading recommendations based on analysis

This project was created as part of my first semester coursework to explore how autonomous AI agents can collaborate, reason, and maintain memory in a simple but practical system.
